# Word count auto-tracker
Type into the text box, and the word count live-updates every time you make any
change. No need to open a word count popup -- no need to choose between text
editing and word-count obsessing.

There is a radio group allowing you to specify whether or not to split words at
hyphens. This is because the UC undergraduate application considers hyphenated
words as two words, while the Common Application considers hyphenated words as
singular words.

Potential future improvements:
* Hitting Ctrl + Enter (or some other intuitive shortcut) makes a new textarea
  that takes focus, and another word count tracker appears for that word area.
