# Word count auto-tracker
Concept: You type into a text box, and a word count tracker next to the text box
live-updates every time you change the word count. No need to open a word count
popup -- no need to choose between text editing and word-count obsessing.

Additional details:
* There will be checkboxes at the top of the page signifying whether to split
  words at hyphens or not and so on (I'll need to do some research to see how UC
  vs Common App counts words and so on).
* Hitting Ctrl + Enter (or some other intuitive shortcut) makes a new textarea
  and word count tracker appear and moves the cursor there.
